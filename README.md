# 19_UnsupervisedLearning_Challenge
## Overview

This repository contains a main file and a correlating file with CSV files for analyzing CSV data into the Jupyter Notebook file. The directions for the module were to use knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Results

In the 19_UnsupervisedLearning_Challenge, this dataset is an analysis of different crypto market prices, which are normalized with the StandardScaler module. Further analysis was plotted using K-means model and the elbow method to select the best clustering values. A second analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was also used and modeled again with the K-means model to contrast the data to see if the model fit better by using PCA features over scaled features.

## Usage

You can use this file to analyze the data in the corresponding resource CSV.

1. Open the respective file (`Crypto_Clustering.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.

2. Make sure that the resource and analysis directories are congruent within their respective places as listed in the script, if not change the location.

3. Run individual cells within to see the calculations.
